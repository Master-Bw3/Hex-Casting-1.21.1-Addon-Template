# Hex Template

[![powered by hexdoc](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://hexxy.media/api/v0/badge/hexdoc?label=1)](https://github.com/hexdoc-dev/hexdoc)

This is an up-to-date, opinionated template for starting a **multiloader, Kotlin-based** Hex Casting addon on 1.21.1 with Cloche. Includes all necessary dependencies on both Neoforge and Fabric loaders, plus some demo bits. 

This template is based on [HexDummy](https://github.com/FallingColors/hexdummy#usage) by FallingColors

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do not fork or clone this repository** to set up a new mod! See the usage steps and FAQ for more details.

> [!TIP]
> If you're writing a Fabric-only or Forge-only mod, you probably don't need this template. Consider using the [Fabric template mod generator](https://fabricmc.net/develop/template/) or [Neoforge MDK](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/1.21.1/gettingstarted/) instead.

## Usage

1. Install the prerequisites:
   - [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
   - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
   - Any IDE with Java and Kotlin support (recommended: [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows))
2. Create, clone, and enter a **new** GitHub repo. You don't need to use any other project templates (e.g. IntelliJ's Minecraft mod template) with Hex Template.
> [!CAUTION]
> **Do not** fork/clone/copy this repo directly.
3. From the repo root, run this command to copy the template, then follow the prompts to set it up:
   ```sh
   uvx copier copy gh:Master-Bw3/Hex-Casting-1.21.1-Addon-Template .
   ```
4. Set up your Python environment and lockfile:
   ```sh
   uv sync

   .\.venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   . .venv/bin/activate.fish  # fish
   source .venv/bin/activate  # everything else
   ```
5. Look through the generated project to make sure everything looks good, then add, commit, and push the generated files (including `uv.lock`):
   ```
   git add .
   git update-index --chmod=+x gradlew
   git commit -m "Set up mod template"
   git push
   ```
6. Follow the [hexdoc setup instructions](https://hexdoc.hexxy.media/docs/guides/deployment/github-pages) for GitHub Pages.
7. Set up the release workflow:
   1. In your GitHub repository settings, create two new environments called `pypi` and `curseforge-modrinth`.
   2. Add the following environment secrets (**not** environment variables) to the `curseforge-modrinth` environment:
      - `CURSEFORGE_TOKEN`: Generate a new [CurseForge API token](https://authors-old.curseforge.com/account/api-tokens).
      - `MODRINTH_TOKEN`: Generate a new [Modrinth PAT](https://modrinth.com/settings/pats) with the `Create versions` scope.
   3. [Create a PyPI pending publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/creating-a-project-through-oidc/) with the following settings:
      - PyPI Project Name: The `project.name` value in your `pyproject.toml` (eg. `hexdoc-hexcasting`)
      - Owner: Your GitHub username
      - Repository name: Your GitHub repository name
      - Workflow name: `release.yml`
      - Environment name: `pypi`
   4. If you'd like to publish your mod to https://maven.hexxy.media, [follow these instructions](https://gist.github.com/object-Object/f9988135bec5cef653c668712954f429) to set it up.
   5. When your mod is ready, [manually trigger a release](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/manually-run-a-workflow) through the Actions tab on GitHub.

## FAQ

### Why isn't this a template repository / why shouldn't I fork this repo to set up my mod?

Hex Template uses [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io), a Python app for generating projects from *parameterized* templates. When you run `uvx copier copy`, Copier clones this repository, prompts you for some values, then fills those values into many placeholders in the template, making a customized project with no placeholder values for you to have to replace by hand.

As a consequence, this repository by itself is *not* a working Minecraft mod - if you look in the [template](./template) directory, you'll see a lot of `.jinja` files with placeholders that still need to be filled in.

### How do I add dependencies?

- Maven repositories: `build.gradle.kts`
- Dependency definitions: `libs.versions.toml` ([Gradle docs](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/version_catalogs.html#sec::toml-dependencies-format))
- Gradle dependency configurations: `build.gradle.kts -> cloche -> (common/fabric/neoforge)` (depending which platform you need it on)
- hexdoc dependencies: `pyproject.toml` and `doc/hexdoc.toml` (remember to run `uv sync` to update `uv.lock` after changing)
- Local JAR dependency files: `libs/`
- Maven repositories for Gradle plugins: `settings.gradle.kts`

### Why is the release workflow triggered manually?

Minecraft mod releases tend to be brittle. Hex Template's release workflow includes separate inputs for each platform your mod is released to, so if some of them fail but others succeed, you can manually fix and re-release just the failing parts, rather than having to push a new tag or commit and release everything again.

### What's a (ModName)Registrar?

Hex Template generates a Registrar base class that you can use to register things in all registries, vanilla or modded, for all platforms.

To add a registrar for a registry, [create an `object` subclassing the registrar](https://github.com/object-Object/HexDummyExample/blob/a7d8d5b58bd018a62456e4653fe46ba3eb22bc69/common/src/main/kotlin/io/github/objectobject/hexdummyexample/registry/HexdummyexampleActions.kt#L11-L14), and pass  the ResourceKey of the registry and a callback that returns the actual registry to the superclass. (A callback is used to avoid initializing the registry too early on Neoforge.) Add the subclass to the [initRegistries call](https://github.com/object-Object/HexDummyExample/blob/a7d8d5b58bd018a62456e4653fe46ba3eb22bc69/common/src/main/kotlin/io/github/objectobject/hexdummyexample/Hexdummyexample.kt#L21) in your common mod initializer.

Registering things with the Registrar generally looks like this:

```kt
val REGISTERED_THING = register("registered_thing") { ThingConstructor("parameters") }
```

`register` takes a callback for the same reason as the registry object: to avoid constructing the instance too early on Forge. The string is used as the path for a ResourceLocation, with your mod id as the namespace.

The value returned by `register` is an [`Entry<V>`](https://github.com/object-Object/HexDummyExample/blob/a7d8d5b58bd018a62456e4653fe46ba3eb22bc69/common/src/main/kotlin/io/github/objectobject/hexdummyexample/registry/HexdummyexampleRegistrar.kt#L50). You can use this to access the registered thing's id (`.id`) or ResourceKey (`.key`), and when you're sure registration has finished, the actual registered instance (`.value`).

For a more concrete example, the template comes with an [example for registering patterns](TODO https://github.com/object-Object/HexDummyExample/blob/a7d8d5b58bd018a62456e4653fe46ba3eb22bc69/common/src/main/kotlin/io/github/objectobject/hexdummyexample/registry/HexdummyexampleActions.kt), and HexDebug has [several more examples](https://github.com/object-Object/HexDebug/tree/5db5f78f5489863e2c20a3df472571a984877b7d/Common/src/main/kotlin/gay/object/hexdebug/registry) for various types of registries.

## TODO

- Set up Mod Publish
- Set up Github Actions Workflows
- See if there's a better way to download dependencies for CI tests than just manually listing Modrinth URLs.
- Improve documentation.
- Investigate https://github.com/headlesshq/mc-server-test more. From the logs, it seems like the Fabric server test might not actually be loading any mods?
- Fix the CI tests in this repository.
- Figure out how to publish to CurseForge/Modrinth/GitHub without having to build the mod again.
